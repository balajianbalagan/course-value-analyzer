Here are some key responsibilities and tasks typically associated with the role of a DevOps Developer:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Implementing CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, testing, and deployment of software applications. This involves setting up version control systems, configuring build servers, defining automated testing frameworks, and establishing deployment pipelines.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Using configuration management tools (such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef) and infrastructure provisioning tools (such as Terraform or CloudFormation) to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources. You define infrastructure requirements as code, enabling infrastructure to be provisioned consistently and reproducibly.

Configuration Management: Managing and automating the configuration of systems and applications using tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. This includes managing configuration files, software packages, and environment-specific settings to ensure consistency and scalability across different environments.

Monitoring and Logging: Implementing monitoring and logging solutions to gain visibility into system performance, identify issues, and track application logs. You set up monitoring tools, configure alerts and notifications, and analyze logs to diagnose and resolve problems proactively.

Containerization and Orchestration: Using containerization technologies such as Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to package and deploy applications in isolated and portable containers.
